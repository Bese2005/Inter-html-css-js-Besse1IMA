        <p>
            <p>The float CSS property places an element on the left or right side of its container, allowing text and inline elements to wrap around it. The element is removed from the normal flow of the page, though still remaining a part of the flow (in contrast to absolute positioning).</p>
                <p>A <em>floating element</em> is one where the computed value of <code>float</code> is not <code>none</code>.</p>
                        <p>As <code>float</code>&nbsp;implies the use of the block layout, it modifies the computed value of the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/display"><code>display</code></a> values, in some cases:</p>
        </p>
        <h3>How floated elements are positioned</h3>
        <img class="bildetilhøyre" src="chain.jpg" alt=""><p>As mentioned above, when an element is floated, it is taken out of the normal flow of the document (though still remaining part of it). It is shifted to the left, or right, until it touches the edge of its containing box, <em>or another floated element</em>.</p>
             <p>A floated element is at least as tall as its tallest nested floated children. We gave the parent <code>width: 100%</code> and floated it to ensure it is tall enough to encompass its floated children, and to make sure it takes up the width of the parent so we don't have to clear its adjacent sibling.</p>
